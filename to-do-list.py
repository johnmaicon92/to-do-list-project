Introduction
In this project, you will apply your Python programming skills to create a functional To-Do List Application from scratch. The objective of this project is to reinforce your understanding of Python syntax, data types, control structures, functions, and error handling while building a practical and interactive application.

Project Requirements
User Interface (UI):
Create a command-line interface (CLI) for the To-Do List Application.
Display a welcoming message and a menu with the following options:
        Welcome to the To-Do List App!

        Menu:
        1. Add a task
        2. View tasks
        3. Mark a task as complete
        4. Delete a task
        5. Quit


To-Do List Features:

Implement the following features for the To-Do List:
Adding a task with a title (by default “Incomplete”).
Viewing the list of tasks with their titles and statuses (e.g., "Incomplete" or "Complete").
Marking a task as complete.
Deleting a task.
Quitting the application.



User Interaction:

Allow users to interact with the application by selecting menu options using input().
Implement input validation to handle unexpected user input gracefully.
Error Handling:
Implement error handling using try, except, else, and finally blocks to handle potential issues.


Code Organization:

Organize your code into functions to promote modularity and readability.
Use meaningful function names with appropriate comments and docstrings for clarity.
Testing and Debugging:
Thoroughly test your application to identify and fix any bugs.
Consider edge cases, such as empty task lists or incorrect user input.


Documentation:

Include a README file that explains how to run the application and provides a brief overview of its features.
Optional Features (Bonus):
If you feel adventurous, you can add extra features like task priorities, due dates, or color-coding tasks based on their status.


GitHub Repository:

Create a GitHub repository for your project.
Commit your code to the repository regularly.
Include a link to your GitHub repository in your project documentation.


Submission

Submit your project, including all source code files and the README, to your instructor or designated platform.
NOTE: Ensure that all code in your file is ready to run. This means that if someone opens your file and clicks the run button at the top, all code executes as intended. For example, if there are if statements, print statements, or for loops, they should function correctly and display output in the console as expected. If you have a function, make sure the function is called and runs.

The goal of this note is to ensure that all code in your Python file runs smoothly and that is has been tested.
